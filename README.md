TwitterSpritz
=============

This is a small Node.js application that filters all public tweets based on the keyword 'awesome' and displays them using Spritz reader technology.

We are not using an official Spritz SDK (yet) but instead a "spritz style reader" replica implemented by Richard Tagger: https://github.com/richardtagger/spritz-js

How to use
=============

1. Open app.js and add your Twitter API access info in the 'ADD HERE' strings.
2. Run 'node app.js' from the command line.
3. Go to http://127.0.0.1/ from your browser.
4. Enjoy reading the Tweet stream via Spritz!

Disclaimer
=============

Spritz has a huge number of possibilities and this project was built for fun. I do not plan to add much to it in future. Please feel free to fork until your heart is content!
